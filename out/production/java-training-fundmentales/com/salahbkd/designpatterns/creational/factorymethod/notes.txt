used when a class doesn't know exactly what object types need to be created

the candy analogy, we want different kind of candies, We have CandyStore, CandyFactory,
CandyClient, if we want different kind of candies the we won't implement the logic in candy store,
we will be talking to the CandyFactory to create that kind of candy.

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects
in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
