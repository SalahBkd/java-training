--the problem
    we wanna make an image storing feature, we gonna make a class ImageStorage that
    gonna responsible for storing the images, but we want to COMPRESS & FILTER
    the images before storing them.

    the STORING & COMPRESSING & FILTERING operations must be separated or we gonna
    violate the SR principle.

--usecase
    introduce a new interface Compresser with compressing functions
    introduce a new interface Filter with filtering functions

    introduce a new class JPEGCompresser that implements Compresser interface
    introduce a new class PNGCompresser that implements Compresser interface

    introduce a new class BWFilter that implements Filter interface
    introduce a new class ContrastFilter that implements Filter interface

    in main, we instantiate the ImageStorage class and we passe it what filter and what
    compressor we want, CONSTRUCTOR DEPENDENCY INJECTION
