what is a queue ?
	A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are 
	performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue 
	of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. 
	The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item 
	the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
