Intro to functional programming
	I/O with functions (pure)
	Immutable data - copies (persistent data structures)
	Side affects
	first class functions
	
Important Notes About Functional Programming
	Programming paradigm
	rotted in mathematics
	language independent
	key principle: all the computation is the execution of mathematical functions
	function: 
		mapping inputs to outputs
		can't change their inputs
		can't change variables (Immutability)
		programming without variable assignment 
		
Pros of immutability
	programs are logical 
	built for distributed computing
	easy to test
	
Why i should care ?
	Functional code tends to be more concise, more predictable, and simpler to test
Cons
	intimidating to learn
