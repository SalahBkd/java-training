--the problem
    def: used to provide a simple interface for a complex system

    usecase: imagine we want to implement a push notification feature
    NotificationServer = connect() -> return Connection that we gonna close
    authenticate(appId, key) -> AuthToken
    send(authToken, message, target)
    conn.disconnect()

    with this approach, the Main program will depend heavily on the NotificationServer, AuthToken
    Connection objects if want to make a change all those classes will be affected.

    solution: introduce a new interface that will have a send method thats gonna responsible
    for the push notification, and implement it through various classes (Main..etc)
