--the problem
    used to add additional behavior to an object
    imagine we want to implement a storage feature ina cloud-service,
    we introduce a CloudStream class

    we want to encrypt data before storing in it, we introduce a EncryptedCloudStream
    that extends CloudStream and overrides store() method

    we want to compress data before storing it, we introduce a CompressedCloudStream
    that extends CloudStream and overrides store() method

    we want to compress and encrypt data, we introduce a CompressedEncryptedCloudStream
    ... that's not efficient, we introduce a class for every feature.
