--the problem
    think of the adapter we use in real life
    used to convert the interface of a class into a different form

    3adna app bghat tahdar m3a email service like Gmail, so khas nzidoha f une liste dyal
    providers li 3adna ms qbal hadchi khasna n importew library dyal gmail li hya class
    w had class khas y implementer une interface dyal EmailProvider, so we wrap an adapter
    GmailAdapter around had GmailClient class library, w mn baed we use GmailAdapter class in our
    program so that we have access to library features + our interface implementation
    features.
