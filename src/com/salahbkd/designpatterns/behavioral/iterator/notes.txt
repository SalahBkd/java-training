--the problem
    how to know the history of our browser ?
    we can make a list in History class and retrieve the elements of that list each time in a loop
    but when we make a change to the History class list variable like we want to use a stack rather than an ArrayList
    the main class that uses History will be broken so we need a way to loose couple our classes


--the solution
    we can make new methods implementations in the History class (current() & next(), hasNext())
    but that violates the SR pricniple, History Management & Iteration
